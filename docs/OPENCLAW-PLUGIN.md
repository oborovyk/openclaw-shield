# `@openclaw-shield/security` — OpenClaw plugin

Runtime security guardrails for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). Single TypeScript plugin, registers four hooks, pure in-process (no subprocess, no Python).

## What it protects

| Hook | Guardrail | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `inbound_claim` | Secret scan on inbound message text (every channel) | Log finding |
| `inbound_claim` | Prompt-injection scan on inbound text | Log + opt-in hard-block (`blockOnInjection: true`) |
| `before_dispatch` | Secret redaction in dispatched body | Rewrites `text` so the agent sees `[openclaw-shield redacted: AWS Access Key → AKIA…YQRE]` instead of the token |
| `before_prompt_build` | Late-binding secret scan on the assembled prompt (catches secrets pulled in via memory/skills/prior turn) | Append-only: logs the finding + appends a refusal-and-rotate instruction to the system prompt. Cannot rewrite the prompt — see "Limitation" below. |
| `before_tool_call` | Destruction-rule scan against canonical shell tools (`bash`, `exec`) | **Block** with `{ block: true, blockReason }` |
| `before_tool_call` | Secret scan on every string param value | **Block** (refuses to send credentials to a tool) |
| `after_tool_call` | Secret scan on shell-tool output | Log masked warning so the model is told not to echo |
| `after_tool_call` | Prompt-injection scan on file/url-read tool results | Log warning (indirect-injection alert) |

### Limitation of before_prompt_build

`PluginHookBeforePromptBuildResult` (defined at `openclaw/src/plugins/hook-before-agent-start.types.ts:28`) only exposes append-only fields (`systemPrompt`, `prepend|appendContext`, `prepend|appendSystemContext`). It cannot mutate `event.prompt` or `event.messages` in place — so we **cannot silently redact** a credential out of memory-injected context at this layer.

What we do instead: detect, log, and append a refusal-and-rotate instruction to the system prompt so the model is told not to echo the secret. Defence-in-depth over silent redaction at this layer. The real fix is rotating the credential — the appended guidance asks the model to recommend that.

### Why inbound_claim and before_dispatch are split

`inbound_claim` fires first but its event is a *copy* of the host's `hookContext` (see openclaw `src/hooks/message-hook-mappers.ts:319`). Mutating `event.bodyForAgent` does NOT propagate back to the dispatcher — `inbound_claim` is therefore observation-only (log + optional `handled: true` hard block via reply).

Actual redaction lives in `before_dispatch`, whose result type `{ handled: false, text }` IS read back by the dispatcher (`src/auto-reply/reply/dispatch-from-config.ts:1886`).

## Install (end users)

One command, any deployment shape (Docker / nix / npm-global / source):

```bash
openclaw plugins install git:github.com/oborovyk/openclaw-shield
openclaw plugins enable openclaw-shield
```

OpenClaw handles the rest — resolves your git credentials, lands the plugin where the runtime expects it, registers the id.

Lifecycle:

```bash
openclaw plugins install git:github.com/oborovyk/openclaw-shield@v0.1.0   # pin to tag/commit
openclaw plugins update    openclaw-shield
openclaw plugins disable   openclaw-shield                # stop running, keep installed
openclaw plugins uninstall openclaw-shield                # remove
openclaw plugins uninstall openclaw-shield --dry-run      # preview
openclaw plugins uninstall openclaw-shield --keep-files   # remove from registry, leave files
```

Nix users: `OPENCLAW_NIX_MODE=1` disables `plugins install/update/uninstall/enable/disable`. Use the [`nix-openclaw`](https://github.com/openclaw/nix-openclaw) source instead.

## Configuration

In your OpenClaw config (e.g. `openclaw.json` / `config/openclaw.yaml`), under `plugins.entries`:

```yaml
plugins:
  entries:
    openclaw-shield:
      inboundClaim:
        scanSecrets: true
        scanInjection: true
        redactSecrets: true       # applied in before_dispatch
        blockOnInjection: false   # set true to hard-reject inbound prompt-injection in inbound_claim
      beforePromptBuild:
        scanAssembledPrompt: true # catch secrets that snuck in via memory/skills/prior turn
      beforeToolCall:
        destruction: true
        scanParamSecrets: true
      afterToolCall:
        scanReadResultsForInjection: true
        scanShellOutputForSecrets: true
      verboseLogging: false       # currently a no-op; reserved for future per-handler diagnostics
```

All flags default to safe-on / block-on values except `inboundClaim.blockOnInjection` (opt-in — chat-text false-positive risk is too high to block by default).

## Secret cache (`src/secret-cache.ts`)

Helper for any plugin code that needs to resolve a 1Password secret without prompting Touch ID on every call.

- Cache dir: `$TMPDIR/.openclaw-shield-cache.<uid>/` (mode 0700). Override via `OPENCLAW_SHIELD_CACHE_DIR=<path>` — useful in Docker, where `/tmp` is ephemeral and the cache is wiped on every container restart. Point at a mounted volume to persist across restarts.
- File format: openssl-compatible (`enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -salt`) — files are inspectable from the shell with the passphrase (Keychain item on macOS, `.salt` file otherwise).
- Passphrase backend: macOS Keychain by default on darwin (service: `openclaw-shield`); on other platforms or with `OPENCLAW_SHIELD_PASSPHRASE_BACKEND=file`, falls back to a `.salt` file in the cache dir. Force the macOS path with `OPENCLAW_SHIELD_PASSPHRASE_BACKEND=keychain` (errors if `security` CLI is missing).
- Threat model:
  - **macOS (default)**: an attacker with read access to the cache dir cannot decrypt anything without also unlocking the Keychain. The Keychain item is gated by the system's standard "Always Allow" consent flow on first access. For wallet-grade strict posture, open Keychain Access → find the `openclaw-shield` item → Get Info → Access Control, and remove the prior Always-Allow entry; every openclaw restart then prompts.
  - **Non-darwin or forced file backend**: obfuscation against backup scanners only, NOT real encryption against an attacker with read access to the home dir.
- TTL: 3h default; override via `OPENCLAW_SHIELD_SECRET_TTL=<seconds>` or per-call `opts.ttl`
- Bypass: `OPENCLAW_SHIELD_NO_CACHE=1` env or per-call `opts.noCache: true`
- Resolution chain: `op read <opPath>` → `opts.envFallback` env var → `null`
- Deployment notes:
  - **macOS**: zero setup; the default `$TMPDIR` persists across reboots.
  - **Docker**: if you use `op read` inside the container, mount a volume and set `OPENCLAW_SHIELD_CACHE_DIR=/cache`. If you inject secrets via plain env vars (the common Docker pattern), the cache hardly matters — `op` typically isn't installed in the container.

```ts
import { secret, clearSecretCache } from "../secret-cache.js";

const token = await secret("op://<vault>/<item>/<field>", {
  envFallback: "MY_TOKEN_ENV_VAR",
});

// Wipe cache (next call re-fetches from op + writes new file under a new salt)
clearSecretCache();
```

## Coverage and gaps

- ✅ Every channel that delivers through `inbound_claim` (Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, Discord, Signal, iMessage, …) is covered uniformly. Telegram isn't special.
- ✅ Every tool execution flows through `before_tool_call` → covered.
- ✅ Every dispatched agent prompt gets secret redaction via `before_dispatch`.
- ✅ Late-binding secrets (memory / skills / prior-turn context) are detected at `before_prompt_build`, with refusal guidance appended to the system prompt (we cannot silently redact at this layer — see "Limitation" above).
- ⚠️ Voice transcripts: covered (transcript text → `inbound_claim`). Raw audio: not scanned (different problem).
- ⚠️ Canvas / UI-direct events that bypass `inbound_claim`: not covered.

## Tests

```bash
npm install
npm test       # 64 tests across patterns, cache, config, hooks
```

See [../README.md](../README.md#tests--ci) for layout and CI details.

## Source-build install (contributors only)

If you run OpenClaw from a `git clone` of the openclaw repo and want this plugin in the same workspace (e.g. you're modifying both at once), the repo ships a developer-convenience script:

```bash
# from the openclaw repo root
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oborovyk/openclaw-shield/main/install.sh | bash
```

This clones the plugin into `<openclaw>/extensions/openclaw-shield/` and conditionally appends `extensions/*` to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. `install.sh --uninstall` reverses it (refuses on dirty trees; override with `OPENCLAW_SHIELD_FORCE=1`).

**End users on Docker / nix / npm-global don't need this** — `openclaw plugins install` is the right path.
