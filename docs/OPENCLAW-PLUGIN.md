# `@openclaw-shield/security` — OpenClaw plugin

Runtime security guardrails for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). Single TypeScript plugin, registers four hooks, pure in-process (no subprocess, no Python).

## What it protects

| Hook | Guardrail | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `inbound_claim` | Secret scan on inbound message text (every channel) | Log finding |
| `inbound_claim` | Prompt-injection scan on inbound text | Log + opt-in hard-block (`blockOnInjection: true`) |
| `before_dispatch` | Secret redaction in dispatched body | Rewrites `text` so the agent sees `[openclaw-shield redacted: AWS Access Key → AKIA…YQRE]` instead of the token |
| `before_prompt_build` | Late-binding secret scan on the assembled prompt (catches secrets pulled in via memory/skills/prior turn) | Append-only: logs the finding + appends a refusal-and-rotate instruction to the system prompt. Cannot rewrite the prompt — see "Limitation" below. |
| `before_tool_call` | Destruction-rule scan against canonical shell tools (`bash`, `exec`) | **Block** with `{ block: true, blockReason }` |
| `before_tool_call` | Secret scan on every string param value | **Block** (refuses to send credentials to a tool) |
| `after_tool_call` | Secret scan on shell-tool output | Log masked warning so the model is told not to echo |
| `after_tool_call` | Prompt-injection scan on file/url-read tool results | Log warning (indirect-injection alert) |

### Limitation of before_prompt_build

`PluginHookBeforePromptBuildResult` (defined at `openclaw/src/plugins/hook-before-agent-start.types.ts:28`) only exposes append-only fields (`systemPrompt`, `prepend|appendContext`, `prepend|appendSystemContext`). It cannot mutate `event.prompt` or `event.messages` in place — so we **cannot silently redact** a credential out of memory-injected context at this layer.

What we do instead: detect, log, and append a refusal-and-rotate instruction to the system prompt so the model is told not to echo the secret. Defence-in-depth over silent redaction at this layer. The real fix is rotating the credential — the appended guidance asks the model to recommend that.

### Why inbound_claim and before_dispatch are split

`inbound_claim` fires first but its event is a *copy* of the host's `hookContext` (see openclaw `src/hooks/message-hook-mappers.ts:319`). Mutating `event.bodyForAgent` does NOT propagate back to the dispatcher — `inbound_claim` is therefore observation-only (log + optional `handled: true` hard block via reply).

Actual redaction lives in `before_dispatch`, whose result type `{ handled: false, text }` IS read back by the dispatcher (`src/auto-reply/reply/dispatch-from-config.ts:1886`).

## Install (end users)

One command, any deployment shape (Docker / nix / npm-global / source):

```bash
openclaw plugins install git:github.com/oborovyk/openclaw-shield
openclaw plugins enable openclaw-shield
```

OpenClaw handles the rest — resolves your git credentials, lands the plugin where the runtime expects it, registers the id.

Lifecycle:

```bash
openclaw plugins install git:github.com/oborovyk/openclaw-shield@v0.1.0   # pin to tag/commit
openclaw plugins update    openclaw-shield
openclaw plugins disable   openclaw-shield                # stop running, keep installed
openclaw plugins uninstall openclaw-shield                # remove
openclaw plugins uninstall openclaw-shield --dry-run      # preview
openclaw plugins uninstall openclaw-shield --keep-files   # remove from registry, leave files
```

Nix users: `OPENCLAW_NIX_MODE=1` disables `plugins install/update/uninstall/enable/disable`. Use the [`nix-openclaw`](https://github.com/openclaw/nix-openclaw) source instead.

## Configuration

In your OpenClaw config (e.g. `openclaw.json` / `config/openclaw.yaml`), under `plugins.entries`:

```yaml
plugins:
  entries:
    openclaw-shield:
      inboundClaim:
        scanSecrets: true
        scanInjection: true
        redactSecrets: true       # applied in before_dispatch
        blockOnInjection: false   # set true to hard-reject inbound prompt-injection in inbound_claim
      beforePromptBuild:
        scanAssembledPrompt: true # catch secrets that snuck in via memory/skills/prior turn
      beforeToolCall:
        destruction: true
        scanParamSecrets: true
      afterToolCall:
        scanReadResultsForInjection: true
        scanShellOutputForSecrets: true
      verboseLogging: false       # currently a no-op; reserved for future per-handler diagnostics
```

All flags default to safe-on / block-on values except `inboundClaim.blockOnInjection` (opt-in — chat-text false-positive risk is too high to block by default).

## Secret cache (`src/secret-cache.ts`)

Helper for any plugin code that needs to resolve a 1Password secret without prompting Touch ID on every call.

- Cache dir: `$TMPDIR/.openclaw-shield-cache.<uid>/` (mode 0700)
- File format: openssl-compatible (`enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -salt`) — files are inspectable from the shell with the per-user salt at `<cache>/.salt`
- Threat model: obfuscation against backup scanners, NOT real encryption against an attacker with read access to the home dir (identical model to silverblock-claude-os)
- TTL: 3h default; override via `OPENCLAW_SHIELD_SECRET_TTL=<seconds>` or per-call `opts.ttl`
- Bypass: `OPENCLAW_SHIELD_NO_CACHE=1` env or per-call `opts.noCache: true`
- Resolution chain: `op read <opPath>` → `opts.envFallback` env var → `null`

```ts
import { secret, clearSecretCache } from "../secret-cache.js";

const token = await secret("op://<vault>/<item>/<field>", {
  envFallback: "MY_TOKEN_ENV_VAR",
});

// Wipe cache (next call re-fetches from op + writes new file under a new salt)
clearSecretCache();
```

## Coverage and gaps

- ✅ Every channel that delivers through `inbound_claim` (Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, Discord, Signal, iMessage, …) is covered uniformly. Telegram isn't special.
- ✅ Every tool execution flows through `before_tool_call` → covered.
- ✅ Every dispatched agent prompt gets secret redaction via `before_dispatch`.
- ✅ Late-binding secrets (memory / skills / prior-turn context) are detected at `before_prompt_build`, with refusal guidance appended to the system prompt (we cannot silently redact at this layer — see "Limitation" above).
- ⚠️ Voice transcripts: covered (transcript text → `inbound_claim`). Raw audio: not scanned (different problem).
- ⚠️ Canvas / UI-direct events that bypass `inbound_claim`: not covered.

## Tests

```bash
npm install
npm test       # 64 tests across patterns, cache, config, hooks
```

See [../README.md](../README.md#tests--ci) for layout and CI details.

## Source-build install (contributors only)

If you run OpenClaw from a `git clone` of the openclaw repo and want this plugin in the same workspace (e.g. you're modifying both at once), the repo ships a developer-convenience script:

```bash
# from the openclaw repo root
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oborovyk/openclaw-shield/main/install.sh | bash
```

This clones the plugin into `<openclaw>/extensions/openclaw-shield/` and conditionally appends `extensions/*` to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. `install.sh --uninstall` reverses it (refuses on dirty trees; override with `OPENCLAW_SHIELD_FORCE=1`).

**End users on Docker / nix / npm-global don't need this** — `openclaw plugins install` is the right path.
